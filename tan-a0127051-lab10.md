#### Exercise 1
##### -O0 optimization level
Yes, the buffer clearing code is working at the `-O0` optimization level. When the program tries to print `stack[offset]` to `stack[offset+4]`, 5 zeros were printed.  

##### -O3 optimization level
No, the buffer clearing code is not working at the `-O3` optimization level. When the program tries to print `stack[offset]` to `stack[offset+4]`, `49 50 51 52 53` was printed. These are the ACSII code values for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively.

The difference between `-O0` and `-O3` is `zero_buf` is called in `-O0` but not called in the latter. From the compiler optimisation perspective, it makes sense that the `zero_buf` is not called in `-O3`. This is because the result of `zero_buf` was not used directly by any code in *L10.c*. Therefore, the compiler deemed that calling `zero_buf` is unnecessary and does not include the instruction to call `zero_buf` in `-O3`.

##### Security issue and potential mismatch
Yes, there is a potential mismatch between the intent of the programmer and the compiler and it can be a security issue.

The programmer's intention is to remove the sensitive data `secret` from memory using `zero_buf`. However, the optimising compiler thinks that `zero_buf` is not doing any useful computation - it identifies `zero_buf` as dead store because the memory written to by `zero_buf` is not used directly subsequent to the call of `zero_buf` so it removes the call to `zero_buf`. Unfortunately, this means that the sensitive data `secret` is left in the memory and a malicious user can access the memory location of `secret` and discover the sensitive data. Hence, the optimisation made by the compiler can lead to an security issue.

#### Exercise 2
In my patch, I added a `volatile` keyword to `p` in `zero_buf`:
```
void zero_buf(volatile char *p, size_t n)
```
My patch works because the `volatile` keyword will tell the compiler not to perform any optimisations on the variable `p`. Since `zero_buf` uses the variable `p`, the instruction that calls `zero_buf` will not be optimised away by an optimising compiler.
